I’m Aster, pronouns she/her. I’m a seasoned full-stack engineer with over ten years experience. I’m currently a Senior Software Engineer at Plume, working to weave trans equity into the fabric of healthcare technology. My journey’s taken me from places like The New York Times and Medium to where I am now, passionately working remotely (and loving it!).\nIn my world, tech is more than just code; it’s a path to making things fairer for everyone. I’ve got a knack for full-stack web development and a soft spot for creating slick infrastructure pipelines – think Cloudflare, Fastly, AWS Lambda, you name it. And yes, I’m that person who gets excited about continuous deployment. I’m currently studying embedded engineering in my spare time, and thoroughly enjoy building systems that help people in a tangible way.\nBut hey, life’s not all about tech, right? When I’m not coding, you might find me in my garden, woodworking, or plunking out a melody on my MIDI boards. I believe in balancing the digital with the down-to-earth, which helps keeps me grounded.\nSo, that’s a bit about me. I’m here to make a mark, not just in tech, but in how we think about equity and accessibility in this ever-evolving digital age. Let’s connect and make some waves!\n\nWork Experience\nVolunteer Experience\nSide Projects\n\nWoodworking\nEmbedded Engineering\nHomesteading\nSpoken Language Learning\nQueer Theory\n\n\n"},"side_projects/embedded_eng/index":{"title":"Side Projects: Embedded Engineering","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nnote: I’m still building out this page, check back soon for more info"},"side_projects/homestead/index":{"title":"Side Projects: Homesteading","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nnote: I’m still building out this page, check back soon for more info"},"side_projects/index":{"title":"Side Projects","links":["side_projects/embedded_eng/","side_projects/woodworking/","side_projects/homestead/","side_projects/spoken_language/","side_projects/queer/"],"tags":[],"content":"If there’s one thing you should know about me, it’s that I thrive on variety. My mind is a buzzing hub of ideas, constantly exploring new horizons. This passion for diverse pursuits has led me to embark on an array of side projects, each uniquely enriching and challenging.\nFrom dabbling in the latest web technologies to experimenting with digital art, every project is a journey into uncharted territory. I’ve found joy in gardening, where the rhythmic nature of nurturing plants offers a serene counterbalance to the digital world. My musical endeavors, whether it’s mastering a new instrument or composing, fuel my creativity in unexpected ways.
